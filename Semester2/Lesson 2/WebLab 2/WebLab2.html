        <td>Purdue University</td>
        <td>West Lafayette, Indiana</td>
        <td>Purdue's campus is situated in the small city of West Lafayette, near the western bank of the Wabash River, across which sits the larger city of Lafayette. State Street, which is concurrent with State Road 26, divides the northern and southern portions of campus. Academic buildings are mostly concentrated on the eastern and southern parts of campus, with residence halls and intramural fields to the west, and athletic facilities to the north. The Greater Lafayette Public Transportation Corporation (CityBus) operates eight campus loop bus routes on which students, faculty, and staff can ride free of charge with Purdue Identification.</td>
        <td>I am choosing Purdue University as a possible option since it is an excellent engineering school. I hope to major in mechanical engineering, Purdue's most popular major. An engineering degree from Purdue will look impressive for when I apply to medical school.</td>

        <td>University of Southern California</td>
        <td>Los Angeles, California</td>
        <td>The University Park campus is in the University Park district of Los Angeles, 2 miles (3.2 km) southwest of Downtown Los Angeles. The campus's boundaries are Jefferson Boulevard on the north and northeast, Figueroa Street on the southeast, Exposition Boulevard on the south, and Vermont Avenue on the west. Since the 1960s, through campus vehicle traffic has been either severely restricted or entirely prohibited on some thoroughfares. The University Park campus is within walking distance to Los Angeles landmarks such as the Shrine Auditorium, Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, and Los Angeles Coliseum. Most buildings are in the Romanesque Revival style, although some dormitories, engineering buildings, and physical sciences labs are of various Modernist styles (especially two large Brutalist dormitories at the campus's northern edge) that sharply contrast with the predominantly red-brick campus. Widney Alumni House, built in 1880, is the oldest university building in Southern California. In recent years the campus has been renovated to remove the vestiges of old roads and replace them with traditional university quads and gardens. The historic portion of the main campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.</td>
        <td>I am looking at this school for two main reasons: it's a very well respected, known school and the location is close to home for me. USC also has a good engineering department and remarkable medical school for me to apply to after getting my undergraduate education done.</td>

        <td>Vanderbilt University</td>
        <td>Nashville, Tennessee</td>
        <td>The Vanderbilt campus is located approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km) southwest of downtown in the West End neighborhood of midtown Nashville. It has an area of 330 acres (1.3 km2), though this figure includes large tracts of sparsely used land in the southwest part of the main campus, as well as the Medical Center.[107] The historical core of campus encompasses approximately 75 acres (0.3 km2).</td>
        <td>I am considering Vanderbilt as the name is held with such prestige. Vanderbilt is not an Ivy League school, but is still such an exceptional school that is hard to get accepted into. I would hope to graduate from Vanderbilt's medical school after getting my undergraduate education done.</td>

        <td>Rice University</td>
        <td>Houston, Texas</td>
        <td>Rice's campus is a heavily wooded 285-acre (115-hectare) tract of land located close to the city of West University Place, in the museum district of Houston.

            Five streets demarcate the campus: Greenbriar Street, Rice Boulevard, Sunset Boulevard, Main Street, and University Boulevard. For most of its history, all of Rice's buildings have been contained within this "outer loop". In recent years, new facilities have been built close to campus, but the bulk of administrative, academic, and residential buildings are still located within the original pentagonal plot of land. The new Collaborative Research Center, all graduate student housing, the Greenbriar building, and the Wiess President's House are located off-campus.

            Rice prides itself on the amount of green space available on campus; there are only about 50 buildings spread between the main entrance at its easternmost corner, and the parking lots and Rice Stadium at the West end. The Lynn R. Lowrey Arboretum, consisting of more than 4000 trees and shrubs (giving birth to the legend that Rice has a tree for every student), is spread throughout the campus.

            The university's first president, Edgar Odell Lovett, intended for the campus to have a uniform architecture style to improve its aesthetic appeal. To that end, nearly every building on campus is noticeably Byzantine in style, with sand and pink-colored bricks, large archways and columns being a common theme among many campus buildings. Noteworthy exceptions include the glass-walled Brochstein Pavilion, Lovett College with its Brutalist-style concrete gratings, and the eclectic-Mediterranean Duncan Hall. In September 2011, Travel+Leisure listed Rice's campus as one of the most beautiful in the United States</td>
        <td>I am considering Rice because not only is it a great school, the campus is located in Houston. Houston is filled with exceptional hospitals that are some of the nation's finest. I hope to start my life in Houston. Rice is definately my first and preferred college choice.</td>

        <td>Texas A & M</td>
        <td>College Station, Texas</td>
        <td>Texas A&M's College Station campus, one of the largest in America, spans 5,200 acres (21 km2) plus 350 acres (1 km2) for Research Park.[3][15] The university is part of the Bryan-College Station metropolitan area located within Brazos County in the Brazos Valley (Southeast Central Texas) region, an area often referred to as "Aggieland".[118] According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2008, the population of Brazos County is estimated at 175,122.[119] Money Magazine, in 2006, named College Station the most educated city in Texas, and the 11th most educated American city, due largely to the presence of the university and the size and scope of its research.[120] Aggieland is centrally located within 200 miles (320 km) of 3 of the 10 largest cities in the US and 75% of the Texas and Louisiana populations (approximately 13 million people). The area's major roadway is State Highway 6, and several smaller state highways and Farm to Market Roads connect the area to larger highways such as Interstate 45. The campus is bisected by a railroad track operated by Union Pacific.[122] The area east of the tracks, known as Main Campus, includes buildings for the colleges of engineering, architecture, geosciences, science, education and liberal arts. Dormitories, as well as the main dining centers and many campus support facilities, are also on Main Campus. Notable buildings on Main Campus include Kyle Field, Sterling C. Evans Library, the Academic Building, Harrington Hall, the Memorial Student Center, the Administration Building, Rudder Tower, Albritton Bell Tower, and the Bonfire Memorial.</td>
        <td>I am considering Texas A & M as an option since it is a good mechanical engineering school and is an easier school for me to gte into compared to the other universities. I will likely attend Texas A & M if I can not get accepted into my other choices.</td>
