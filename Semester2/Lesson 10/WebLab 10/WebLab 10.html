            <h1>Background Information</h1>

        </header>
        <p>I, Jimmy Peter Sanchez Jr. was born on April 1, 2000 at Mercy Hospital located in San Francisco, California. I am named after my father, Jimmy Peter Sanchez Sr. My mother, Rosie Sanchez was very proud to give birth to me, her first child. I lived in the Bay area all the way until I was three years of age. My father was president of Siemens Transportation, so we lived in the Bay as he worked in Sacramento where his headquarters were located. My mother did not work and instead watched over me as a young kid. During the summer of 2003, my dad decided to leave Siemens and instead pursue real estate development. Durimg the summer of 2003, we moved to Tehachappi, California, my dad's hometown. Tehachappi was a small town in which we knew everyone there. In fact, my grandparents and extended family also lived in the small town. I would live in Tehachappi all the way until I was 12 years old. During my living in Tehachappi, my immediate family actually was poor. After leaving Siemens, a bad investment caused my dad to lose lots of money. During our time as a poor family, we remained happy. I remember when i was little my grandparents bringing groceries since we could not afford much. My dad has a little bit of money saved which would be used for a real estate investment. Soon, my younger sister Brianna was born on May 9, 2003. Brianna would certainly bond with me during my childhood. During 2004, my dad took his little bit of money and also got a personal loan. My dad bought a property and built a garage with a bedroom all by himself. There is pictures of my dad using his truck's winch to frame the garage with no help. My dad certainly made sacrifices that would later pay off. After the structure was built, my dad made a large profit enough to pay off his loan and still have more money aside to pursue other projects. My dad would continue small projects and would start building large homes in 2008. In 2008, my dad experienced great financial success. Today, my dad owns a large real estate development company which hr buys large properties and develops commercial buildings and hospitals using his own funds to make profits. My family has come a long way. This is just a background on me which would shape my ambition and attitude toward life. My dad has certainly been a person whom I have looked up to. Anything is possible!</p>

            <h1>Current Education</h1>

        </header>
        <p>After completing my eighth grade year at St. John's, I decided to test at Cathedral Catholic High School. After receiving a good placement score, I was admitted into CCHS along with taking advanced classes for a freshman. I had a good experience at CCHS especially with weekend retreats and camps available. During my second semester of my junior year, i experienced some tough discipline from the school. During March of 2017, I made a poor decision by making a dumb and offensive statement. Normally, my action would result in immediate expulsion. Because the school felt I was sorry, they asked me to withdraw so nothing would go on my record. The principal and dean of students have allowed me to come back for my senior year if I complete some of their conditions. For the remainder of my junior year, I am finishing at Torrey Pines. However, I will be back at CCHS in August after learning my tough lesson.</p>

        </header>
        <p>I enjoy a variety of hobbies which include dirt bike riding, participating in sports (football, basketball, and tennis), playing guitar, and attending classic car shows. I started riding dirtbikes when I was four years old. In fact, I would break my femur in a dirtbike race when i was six. I started playing football in the Pop Warner level when I was 12. I played high school football during my freshman and sophomore years. I played the positions of inside linebacker and defensive end during my high school seasons. I played basketball starting when I was in sixth grade all the way until I was a high school freshman. I primarily played the position of forward. I started playing tennis as a freshman and have continued ever since. I enjoy playing both singles and doubles! I played on the Varsity level starting junior year and have become quite good. I started playing guitar when I was eight years old. I have been quite good at guitar! I play songs from Van Halen, Guns N' Roses, Metallica, Ozzy Osbourne, and much more. Guitar playing is my passion.</p>
